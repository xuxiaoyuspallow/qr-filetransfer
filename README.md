# qr-filetransfer
Inspired by https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qr-filetransfer, I write this python version for fun

## how to use
first, you need to clone the code

```git clone git@github.com:xuxiaoyuspallow/qr-filetransfer.git```

then, install dependencies  
```pip3 install -r requirements```

ok, then enjoy it

```python3 qr-filetransfer.py file-path```
